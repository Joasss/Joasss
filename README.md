Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zaphyr/Joa_sss, a Javascript, HTML and learning python developer from the Netherlands.
I've worked on QuaBot for about a year, wich is now discontinued.
Languages i know are: Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python (learning), C++ and java (a little bit)!



**QuaBot**

Was a discord bot written in Javascript used by over 50,000 users, with many features like Music, Reaction Roles, Tickets, Audits and a lot more.

It has since been shut down.
